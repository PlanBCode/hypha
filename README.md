Hypha is a lightweight CMS for small to medium sized communities and project teams, offering the possibility to create a basic website that is easy to set up and maintain.
It is open source and doesn't rely on third party code, making it a safe tool that can be self hosted. Hypha is written in php.

The saying goes: "If you can't open it you don't own it." We'd like to add however: "It's no good if you have to use a screwdriver to simply turn it on."

Hypha's core philosophy is about empowering communities by offering its members intuitive tools rather than learning curves, all while sticking to the ethical standards embedded in open source software. For this reason Hypha is not 'packed with features' but in stead focuses on features that will cater to the basic needs of a community and can be understood by average users of the web. In this philosophy every button that is used by 10% of a community but scares off 90% is a bug, rather than a feature.
